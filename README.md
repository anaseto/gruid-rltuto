# Gruid Go Roguelike Tutorial

This tutorial follows the overall structure of the [TCOD Python
Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2), but makes use of
the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) and the
[gruid](https://github.com/anaseto/gruid) roguelike game framework, instead of
TCOD.

For now, this tutorial also assumes a bit more familiarity with programming and
git: each part is a git branch and will come with a few explanations, but it's
expected that you read the code and comments and diffs between parts using git.

For example, you can [compare
changes](https://github.com/anaseto/gruid-rltuto/compare/part-1...part-2)
between two parts, or see the code of a [particular
part](https://github.com/anaseto/gruid-rltuto/tree/part-1).

* [Part 0 & 1](https://github.com/anaseto/gruid-rltuto/tree/part-1) - Setting Up & Drawing the “@” symbol and moving it around
* [Part 2](https://github.com/anaseto/gruid-rltuto/tree/part-2) - Generic entities and the map
